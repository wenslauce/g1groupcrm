Your backend dashboard becomes a secure transaction command center — every SKR, shipment, or invoice originates from inside G1’s system and is linked to verified client profiles in the CRM.

🧠 Updated Functional Overview

1. SKR Generation System	Create, sign, and store SKRs for client assets or consignments.	① Admin or Finance user initiates SKR → ② System assigns unique SKR number → ③ Linked to client and asset → ④ Generates PDF with hash + signature → ⑤ Stored securely (Supabase Storage).
2. SKR Tracking Dashboard	Track SKR movement, verification, and delivery.	① Internal status updates (Created → In Transit → Delivered → Closed) → ② Optional map-based tracking → ③ Client view (read-only link).
